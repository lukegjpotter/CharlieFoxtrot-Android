# To Do

 1. Update the UI to get rid of the stupid looking Search icon.
 1. Add a second page and Navigation to display results.
 1. Make this second page scroll long text.

 1. Add a database, as the SharedPreferences is a bit of a rookie implementation.
 1. Add a better way of managing the Conversion History deletion.
